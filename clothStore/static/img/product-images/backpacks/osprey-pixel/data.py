	'Description': "This technical commuter pack is sending a message to messenger bag users everywhere: “Use both shoulders!” The Pixel opts for a form fitted, breathable harness and back panel to do its job. The kicker on this bag, though, is a zippered sleeve with touch-sensitive film that hides behind a padded flap, that when opened, allows for quick access to your tablet without removing it from the pack. There’s also a main compartment with document sleeves for filing, a shock-protected laptop sleeve in case you wipe out on your bike and a really smart zippered expansion area that instantly gives you an extra 4L of space.",
